# Summary
## Tool - 1
> A better `OneEditor`.

### Features
- Make `OneEditor` display other languages (more text).

### Future
- In the future you will be able to select the language of your country with the `python` program and have it executed automatically, but for now you need to do it yourself (this will be done in the next official release).  
- New `Setting` page for editing `OneLife` settings (`.ini`).
- Fixed `OneEditor` legacy and existing issues, [View Known Issues](https://github.com/is52hertz/LifeTools-git/issues).
