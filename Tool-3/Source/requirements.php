The game was developed on an old laptop from 2010 with an <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/nvs_techspecs.html">NVS 3100M GPU</a> where it runs at 60 frames per second and is perfectly playable.  In other words, it will most likely run on your computer.<br>
<br>
    The only required library is OpenGL, which ships standard on MacOS and Windows and is readily available on GNU/Linux as well.  On GNU/Linux, you will also need to install SDL 1.2 and xclip for copy/paste support.<br>

Other stuff you will need:
